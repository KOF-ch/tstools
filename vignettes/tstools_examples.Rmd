# About tstools
This packages bundles a set of utilities to juggle and process time series. Why yet another time series package? I realized that economists have some idiosyncratic needs and often a strong fondness of a specific type of graph or outlet that they refuse to give up. Often this fondness is so strong that they use an expensive piece of software just because of a single feature.
Or as one of the open source community's biggest gurus, Dirk Eddelbuettel, put it: ``It's your itch - it's your project.``
For example, *tstools* tries to facilitate the creation of time series plots with two ordinates (Y-axes). Further, *tstools* exports lists of time series into spreadsheet formats, such as .csv or .xlsx.
