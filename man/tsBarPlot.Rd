tsBarPlot(li, show_sums_as_line = T, theme = NULL,
  sum_line_color = "#999999", print_x_axis = T, quarter_ticks = T,
  print_y_axis = T, print_y_right = F, ygrid = T, ygrid_factor = 4,

\arguments{
\item{ygrid_factor}{numeric to devide range by in order to determine y-grid. 
It's suggested to choose a factor that can be devided by 2, because it works
well with symmetric grids.}
