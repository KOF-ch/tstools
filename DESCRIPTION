Description: Plot official statistics' time series conveniently: automatic
    legends, highlight windows, stacked bar chars with positive and
    negative contributions, sum-as-line option, two y-axes with automatic
    horizontal grids that fit both axes and other popular chart types.
    'tstools' comes with a plethora of defaults to let you plot without
    setting an abundance of parameters first, but gives you the
    flexibility to tweak the defaults. In addition to charts, 'tstools'
    provides a super fast, 'data.table' backed time series I/O that allows
    the user to export / import long format, wide format and transposed
    wide format data to various file types.
