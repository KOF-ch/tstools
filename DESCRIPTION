Title: A Time Series Toolbox for Official Statistics
Description: Plot official statistics' time series conveniently: automatic legends, highlight timespans, stacked bar chars with positive and negative contributions, sum-as-line option, two y-axes with automatic horizontal grids that fit both axes and other popular chart types. 'tstools' comes with a plethora of defaults to let you plot without setting an abundance of parameters first, but gives you the flexibility to tweak the defaults. In addition to charts, 'tstools' provides a super fast, 'data.table' backed time series I/O that allows the user to export / import long format, wide format and transposed wide format data to various file types.
