## CRAN Release Preliminary Release Schedule

Dear tstools User, 

we decided to give the project more stability by deploying less frequently to KOF servers and CRAN. 
We plan to compose sets of issues for each release and test the new set of feature thoroughly before deploying.

- 0.3.8: September 11, 2018
- 0.3.9: June 25, 2019

We do admit you'll have to wait for new features a bit longer, but we're confident this the right step as the project gains more users and is more active than ever.

P.S.: If you prefer 'bleeding edge' you can still go with our github master branch.
